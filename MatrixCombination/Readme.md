# I've written three pieces of code and put them in this folder

# Run the code Matrix_Aa.py which will generate the first matrix named A 
        from two original matrix S and C mixed by a sort of algorithm

# The second step is to run the code GenerationA.py,and then there will 
        generate the second matrix A which is the final matrix,the matrix 
        is mixed by the first matrix A and another matrix named D which obtained 
        from a method of bioinformatics analysis with R

# The last code is CalculateWeight which will integrate the matrix in above code and obtained
        a weight value by algorithm
